How to Run:

hoooo boy  
ok um  
need to change the file locations in the const.py thing and use a data file you actually have in the config.py file and set the generations to.. not 200,000  
then should run i think  
well it'll run with 200k but i imagine that's fairly useless  
just use the iris one  
IF YOU WANT  
oh you have to compile the cython shit first  
also it's gonna save a lot of shit  
oh the main thing is gp.py. to run. ahem. will go put my head in the toilet now  



To compile Cython: 

python setup.py build_ext --inplace
